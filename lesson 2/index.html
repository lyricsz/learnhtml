        <h2 id="overview">Course Overview</h2>
        <p>What is HTML? What is it used for? Is HTML a programming languge? Why is it important to HTML? This chapter introduces you to HTML Afresh.</p>
        <h2 id="content">Main Content</h2>
        <p>
            As discussed in the previous chapter, HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. We also discussed what <b>HyperText and Markup</b> is. 
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML is the basic building block of every website. HTML handles our websites presentation for us (with ease). Styling and Dynamicity can't be done using HTML,
            we need two more language (CSS and JavaScript). This is known as the front-end (we'll clarify it more later).
        </p>
        <p>The latest version of HTML is HTML5. It is maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). HTML has transitioned over the years of the first version released. 
            Back in the days we can't use <b>HTML</b> to create Web Games (programmers use Flash), watch movie (without the help of a plugin), play music and lot more. HTML5 made this available to us.
        </p>
        <p>HTML is a markup langauge created by Tim-Berners Lee. When the Internet was first created (WWW) by Tim-Berners Lee, user's can't navigate from a web page to another (web pages are not linked together). To access a webpage, we must enter the URL (or address) manually. This is a lot of headache for web users. HTML fixes this by allowing users to navigate around the web just by clicking HyperText.</p>
        <p>
            Here are the versions of <strong>HTML</strong> over the years (after it's first created):
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>Version</th>
                    <th>Released date</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>HTML</th>
                    <td>1991</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>HTML 2.0</th>
                    <td>1995</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>HTML 3.2</th>
                    <td>1997</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>HTML 4.01</th>
                    <td>1999</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>XHTML 1.0</th>
                    <td>2000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>HTML 5</th>
                    <td>2008-2014</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        <p>The HTML5 version was first recommended by the <b>WHATWG</b> in 2008, but it become standardize on 2014 by the <b>W3C</b>. The W3C are currently working on standardizing some new version of HTML (HTML 5.1 and HTML 5.2). You can learn more about the W3C at their official website.</p>
        </p>
        <p>To further explain what fornt-end is, and it's associated technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript - ES9), HTML is basically like the human-skeleton of our web pages, CSS is like the skin, JavaScript is the live that makes it breath. Let's take a look at below definitions:- </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>HTML</dt>
            <dd>I am the presentation of your webpage, the structure of your webpage.</dd>
            <dt>CSS</dt>
            <dd>I style the look and feel of your webpage, making it beautiful and more appealing.</dd>
            <dt>JavaScript</dt>
            <dd>I make your whole page dynamic and interactive (^-^)</dd>
        </dl>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>What is dynamicity?</legend>
            <p>You might've notice the word "Dynamicity" ealier, this simply means your web page looks different across all users. E.g Amazon looks absolutely different from a user to another user. Static website is just it's opposite. What i see is exactly what other sees. (Web page visitors are often called traffic).</p>
        </fieldset>
        <p>Before we learn about the pros and cons of learning the <b>HTML</b> langauge, let's discuss about the front-end and the back-end </p>
        <p>The front-end is basically what you see on the webpages. However the back-end is like a powerhouse that makes webpage available and accessible. </p>

        <h3>More about Tim-Berners Lee</h3>
        <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee is the creator of the WWW(World Wide Web), HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol), and HTML. </p>
        <p>The HTTP is what makes the communication between a server and a client (traffic) possible. Have you ever wondered why all webpages start with either <b>http</b> or <b>https</b>? Well, now you know. We'll discuss more about this and how to put your website online in ahead chapters...</p>
        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>The Advantages of learning HTML5 is listed below: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML is very easy to learn.</li>
            <li>HTML is the basic building block of every webpages. So, learning it is essential.</li>
            <li>HTML with other web technologies like CSS and JavaScript pave way for <strong>front-end jobs</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Disadvantages of learning HTML5:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Learning HTML, there is only little to no job available for us.</li>
            <li>HTML alone is so boring, static and less appealing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before ending the lesson, Let's try and write some code: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>open any editor of your choice. Create a new file named index.html or index.html </li>
            <li>Input the following code
                <fieldset id="code">
                    <legend>index.html</legend>
                    <div id="copy" onclick="copyText()">&lt;&CirclePlus;Copy&gt;</div>
                    <code id="clipText">
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br />
                        &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt; <br />
                        &lt;head&gt; <br />
                        &lt;title&gt; John Doe Greetings &lt;/title&gt; <br />
                        &lt;/head&gt; <br />
                        &lt;body&gt; <br />
                        &lt;p&gt; Happy New Month &lt;/p&gt; <br />
                        &lt;/body&gt; <br />
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    </code>
                </fieldset>
            </li>
            <li>Save the file. Run it. (If you don't get this, you can start the discussion in the WhatsApp group created for this course).</li>
            <li>And Voila, Our first Html file. </li>

        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Welcome aboard once again</h3>
        <p>
            Hello there. Congratulations on completing the first lesson (we start from lesson 0). And i believe we now have basic understanding of what HTML, CSS and JavaScript is.

            <li>Go back to the text editor, look for the text "John Doe", change it to your name. Send the file to the Group. </li>
