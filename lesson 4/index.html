    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello folks. Before we start the lesson, i'm deeply sorry for the delayed. <br>
    In this lesson we are going to learn about attributes and entities in HTML. These are super useful as they are frequently used in web pages. So... Have fun and hope you 
    enjoy the course.  </p>
    <h2 id="attributes">HTML Attributes</h2>
    <p>We've talked about HTML tags, elements and contents. We've also discussed about void element. (If you didn't know about these yet, kindly review the past lessons). </p>
    <p>HTML Attributes in short adds additional information to a tag. You can also think of these informations as properties. Some tags comes with built in attributes that we 
        can override. And some attribute... are just what we come up with.Web browsers did not understood <strong>Attributes that we come up with</strong>. (But we can use them with other
         languages such as CSS ---styling- and JavaScript ---Dynamic-.)
    </p>
    <p>The first most important attribute we are going to look at is the "lang" attribute. Lang' is short for language. But first of all, where do we put attributes? At the opening tag for both 
        void elements and other element. Take a look at the following template:
        <ul>
            <li>For other element: </li>
            <code>
                &lt;tagName attribut=attributeValue&gt; content &lt;/tagName&gt;
            </code>
            <li>For void element: </li>
            <code>
                &lt;tagName attribute=attributeValue /&gt; 
            </code>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Now that we've seen the syntax of HTML attributes. Let's look at some examples. Starting with the lang' attribute. 
    </p>
    <p>Lang attribute is used to specify the language used in a webpage. If not specified web browser tends to guess by looking at the content of our webpage. This can create lots 
        of hidden trouble. E.g our texts can be rendered in a very weird way we did not want. To fix this, specify the language used by adding a lang attribute to the ROOT opening tag. 
        This is a simple example: <br>
        <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
            &lt;html lang='en'&gt; <br>
            &lt;head&gt; <br>
            &lt;title&gt; This website language is set to English &lt;/title&gt; <br>
            &lt;/head&gt; <br>
            &lt;body&gt; <br>
            &lt;/body&gt; <br>
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            <p>You might be tempted to overlook the lang attribute. This is not recommended. Your website might not be rendered properly in production. 
            So always set the language for your webpage.</p>
        </fieldset>
        Voila. The above code now tells the web browser that "Please don't give me any other language. My language is English. ". 
        The language attribute should be unique. Unless your page is an article with different language. (We'll discussed about this in the future. ) In short, the language you 
        used in a webpage must be consistent. If you start with English, stick with English to the end. 
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Note</legend>
            <p>You can use both double quote and single quote for the attributeValue ðŸ˜‰. In other words both of the following are valid: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Single quote is valid</li>
                    <code>&lt;tagName attribute='attributeValue' /&gt;</code>
                    <li>Double quote is valid</li>
                    <code>&lt;tagName attribute="attributeValue" /&gt;</code>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>But since HTML is so forgiving ("that" has it's limit), the below code is also valid: </p>
            <code>&lt;tagName attribute=attributeValue /&gt;</code> 
            <p>However, even though it is valid. Never use it. Never use it. It's 100% not recommended. Use single quote or double quote instead. </p>
        </fieldset>
        <p>Let's move on to HTML Entities. </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="entities">HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>Let's start with two short story. </p>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Short Story</legend>
        <p>There lived a web developer named Jack. He lived in Massachussets. </p>
        <p>He was writing code, specificly HTML. When he reached the footer... he get stuck looking for the copyright symbol in his keyboard. He couldn't found it. He was about to give up
            when he realized his Uncle, Clerk... is a web developer also who has used copyright symbol in most websites he has built.
        </p>
        <p>He decided to call him. Clerk informs him about HTML entities.</p>
        <p>Ever since then, his life was never the same. </p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Short Story</legend>
        <p>There lived a self-taught web developer named Tom. She had a sibling named Jerry. Both lived alone in Accra. </p>
        <p>A certain night, Jerry came back home and found his sister tired. Tom! What's wrong, he exclaimed. </p>
        <p>Jerry, how did other web developers add more than one spaces to their webpage. I've been trying since the past four hours.
        All the spaces i typed were trimmed to only one space by the web browser. </p>
        <p>Are you kidding me, Tom. Just used non-breaking-space entities and your life will never be the same. </p>
    </fieldset>
    <p>For a second... Imagine if you can write all the stickers, characters, in this world. but how's that even possible? HTML Entities is your answer. 
    HTML Entities adds character to your webpage. This means that whatever you typed stands for something even if it's nothing like "spaces". It is something. Each entity represents a character. There 
    are alot of possible characters available to you. They even range to stickers. </p>
    <p>HTML Entities uses the following syntax: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using entity name: </li>
        <code>&entityName</code>
        <li>Using entity number: </li>
        <code>&#entityNumber</code>
        <li>Using entity hexadecimal: </li>
        <code>&amp;#xentityHexadeciaml</code>
    </ul>
    <p>The above syntax might look cryptic at first. As you use it, you get more familiar with it. You can use any of the three. I use entity name most of the time. </p>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Note</legend>
        <p>If you use entity name, append (or add a prefix) of "&". If you use entity number (decimal 0 - 9 --- base 10), append (or add a prefix) of "&#". If you use entity hexadecimal (0 - 15
            --- base 16), append (or add a prefix) of "&#x". </p>
    </fieldset>
    <p>Let's look at some use cases of HTML Entities. Looking at my keyboard right now i couldn't find copyright symbol. So let's see how how i can add copyright to a webpage using entities. </p>
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt; <br>
        &lt;head&gt; <br>
        &lt;title&gt; A Copyright Page &lt;/title&gt; <br>
        &lt;/head&gt; <br>
        &lt;body&gt; <br>
        &amp;copy <br>
        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
        &lt;/html&gt; <br>
    </code>
    <p>The above code is incorrect. If you run it, it does works right? But always end your HTML Entities with ";". (Always follow the best practices ðŸ˜Š). </p>
    <p>If you fix the above code, kindly share the code to the group. (Don't forget all HTML files ends with '.html' file extension). </p>
    <p>Let's look at some other two most important entities.</p>
    <p>As we've discussed in past lessons, you can't add more than one spaces to your html code. Web browser will trimmed it to only a space. But what if i told you can use entities to achieve
    this goal? We use the non-breaking space entity. This entity is a little bit weird. It exist as if it doesn't exist. It is a space but it is a character. Hence you can add as many space to your webpage as possible. You can also use it to join two words together. ( i think an example will explain this better).
    </p>
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt; <br>
        &lt;head&gt; <br>
        &lt;title&gt; A Non-breaking space  &lt;/title&gt; <br>
        &lt;/head&gt; <br>
        &lt;body&gt; <br>
        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hello world. This line starts with four space. <br>
        (The following words are just one word to the web browser, hence they never seperate.
        They must all be in the same line. If the line is not enough for them, they create scrollbars. Try it out. ) &amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;Lived&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;amazing&amp;nbsp;web&amp;nbsp;developer&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;
        <br>
        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
        &lt;/html&gt; <br>
    </code>
    <p>You can make the second example in the above code as long as possible, but they will never break as seperate words do... since you are using an entity instead of spaces. </p>
    <p>The last most use case is when you want to add a less-than symbol to a webpage or  a greater-than symbol. If you avoid entities, the web browser will automatically think you are starting a tag or closing a tag. But that's not the case. We only want to include them in a webpage. Let's take a look at below code: </p>
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
        &lt;html lang="en"&gt; <br>
        &lt;head&gt; <br>
        &lt;title&gt; Did you know? &lt;/title&gt; <br>
        &lt;/head&gt; <br>
        &lt;body&gt; <br>
        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Did you know? <br>
        20 + 20 &amp;gt; 30 <br>
        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Did you know? <br>
        20 - 20 &amp;lt; 30 <br>
        &lt;/body&gt; <br>
        &lt;/html&gt; <br>
    </code>
    <p>Change the &amp;lt; to &lt; and &amp;gt; to &gt;, notice how the web browser completely misunderstood you? The below table summarizes all HTML entities we've discussed so far: </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Entities name</th>
                <th>Usage</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>nbsp</th>
                <td>I&amp;nbsp;Love&amp;nbsp;You</td>
                <td>Used to add empty character to webpage. Appear the same as adding space to webpage. (nbsp stands for non-breaking space). </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>lt</th>
                <td>is 2 &amp;lt; 4? </td>
                <td>Used to add less-than character to webpage. If normal less-than is used, web browser might think we meant something else. (lt stands for less-than). </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>gt</th>
                <td>is 2 &amp;gt; 4? </td>
                <td>Used to add greater-than character to webpage. If normal greater-than is used, web browser might think we meant something else. (gt stands for greater-than). </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>copy</th>
                <td>&amp;copy;2024 </td>
                <td>Used to add copyright character to webpage. Most keyboards don't have the character. (copy stands for copyright). </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Before we finish the lesson. Here's a quick note. </p>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Note</legend>
        <p>We've discussed what HTML attribue are earlier, but some attribue did not need a value explicitly. If an attribue is either yes/no, true/false, enabled/disabled... By just adding the attribute without the value, it means on/true/yes/enabled e.t.c. and by omiting it, it meant otherwise. Check below example: (It disabled a button, but the attribue has no value)</p>
        <code>
            &lt;button disabled&gt; Click Me &lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
    </fieldset>
    <p>That marks the end of this lesson. :) </p>
    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>Create a html file, add only a copyright to it, and ensure it is a hexadecimal entity. </p>
